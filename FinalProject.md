## Notes 

* Final project does not need to have an equal emphasis on the dimensions of discovery, retrieval, storage, cleaning, analysis/operation

* It could go deep in one of the areas, preferably the area you most care about.

* The final result could be a working application or an analysis with the following artifacts
  
  1. Presentation to the class in late Nov
  2. A short (4-6 page research paper) describing new method, insight or a working application
